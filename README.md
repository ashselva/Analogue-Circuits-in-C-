# Analogue Circuits in C++

A programme to simulate AC circuits was created using the C++ language and standard library. The program was designed to connect arbitrary amount of user created
components in series and/or parallel, and then calculate the total circuit impedance. Other functionality was added, such as the ability to display the user circuit created.
